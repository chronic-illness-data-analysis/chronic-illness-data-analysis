### Why Is This Project Required?
Many people experience suffering chronic diseases and symptoms throughout their life. Chronic
symptoms usually need persistent management and keeping track of, since there is usually no
certain cure for them. Patients usually go through a long period of treatment with different
medications and remedies while tracking the effect.
Analysing and interpreting the relationships between symptoms, treatments, and the
environmental factors to find meaningful patterns can help doctors better understand the nature
of these diseases and better help the patients managing the symptoms.
